###NOT COMPLETE WILL DO IT OVER WEEKEND -- 12/10/2017

##Program name: bookreviews1.py
##The program below reads a dataset containing reviews of Donna Tarttâ€™s The Goldfinch in the Amazon book review. 
##These reviews have been stored in a simple tab separated file, which is nothing more than a plain text file with columns. 
##The table contains four columns: review score, url, review title and review text.
##Your task is to put comments on each line explaining what it does. 
##First few lines are already commented for you. You can put a copy of the code in your GitHub account with the comments in it. Thanks.  

#Import required library
import urllib.request

#Load the data from remote location (URL)
file = urllib.request.urlopen("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/twielfaert/a0972bf366d9aaf6cb1206c16bf93731/raw/dde46ad1fa41f442971726f34ad03aaac85f5414/Donna-Tartt-The-Goldfinch.csv")

f = file.read()

#Transform the bitstream into strings
text = f.decode(encoding='utf-8',errors='ignore')

#Split the string at the end of the lines 
lines = text.split("\n")

#creating an empty list
counts = dict()
counter = 0

#..(split the lines around tabs)
for line in lines:
  l = line.strip().split("\t")
  
#making a framework where stuff is going to be organised into. The document has scores,reviews etc.
## That l looks like a 1 it's a confusing name to give it. 
  score = l[0] 
  id = l[1]
  title = l[2]
  review = l[3]
  
  #counting stuff
  counts[score] = counts.get(score, 0) + 1
  counter = counter + 1 

#print lines and counters converted to strings
#print the number of lines in the file
print(str(counter))
print(str(len(lines)))

# printing the keys and values in the count dictionary
#gives you how many lines for each score, print it out its scores of 1-5.
for key, val in counts.items():
    print (key, val)
